            <h2>Ongoing Mightiest Mark Raid</h2>
            <p class="text-spacing"></p>
            <h3>Rock Terra Type Chesnaught the Unrivaled</h3>
            <p>We are combating this bulky high physical attack and defence Pokemon with a Level 100 special
                attacking
                Grass Terra Type Appletun.
                Bred or Bottle capped
                for Best IV's in all but it's physical attack and trained for Max EV's in Special Attack and
                Physical
                Defence while holding
                the Shell Bell item for health recovery.
                With only a three move set required of Iron Defence, Apple Acid and Giga Drain.</p>
            <!-- Screenshot taken on the Nintendo Switch from my own copy of Pokemon Scarlet -->

                <!-- Screenshot taken on the Nintendo Switch from my own copy of Pokemon Scarlet -->
                <!-- Screenshot is of the in game summary for the Pokemon Appletun that was used for the Chesnaught raid -->
                <div id="appletun" alt="An in game screenshot of a Appletun"><img
                        src="assets/images/appletun-build.webp">
                </div>
                <p>Our full proof strategy to take down Chesnaught consists of a Turn One Iron Defence which we will use
                    to
                    counter Chesnaughts physical moves. Followed by consecutive Apple Acid attacks to fully lower
                    Chesnaughts Special Defence, until we can Terrastalise our Grass type Appletun. Thanks to our high
                    physical defence stats and grass type resitance to Chesnaughts Rock and Ground type attacks as well
                    as
                    the held Shell Bell. Our tough
                    little Appletun can withstand plenty of punishment from the assualting Chesnaught, so there is
                    little
                    risk of being KO'd and waiting to re-enter the raid. So continue to either spam our Unrivaled
                    advisary
                    with
                    more Apple Acid attacks or use Giga Drain if your hp looks concerning for the win. A perfect raid
                    for
                    item farming Ability Patches and Capsules, Iron suppliments also Large and XL experience candies.

            <p class="text-spacing"></p>
            <h3>Part One - The Teal Mask</h3>
            <p>
                The Teal Mask comes as part one of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Expansion Pass. The Teal Mask sees
                your character go on a school trip to
                the land of Kitakami, a Japanese-inspired land which sits at
                the base of a great mountain and is full of rice paddies and apple orchards. Your trip seems to coincide
                with a festival regularly held in the village in Kitakami. The village
                is bustling with various street vendors and stalls. You’ll meet new friends and Pokémon as you unravel
                the mysteries
                behind the folktales that have been passed down in this land.</p>
            <p>Scheduled for release Fall 2023</p>
            <p class="text-spacing"></p>
            <h3>Part 2 - The Indigo Disk</h3>
            <p>The Indigo Disk will have you attend the
                Blueberry Academy, the Naranja/Uva Academy's sister school. The Blueberry
                Academy is a relatively new school, and while there, you'll take classes and meet a whole host of new
                characters. There
                are a few standout features of this new school, its curriculum puts a particular emphasis on Pokémon
                battling. Most surprising of all is the fact that most of the
                school’s building is located under the ocean.</p>
            <p>Scheduled for release Winter 2023</p>
            <p>Those that purchase the upcoming content before October 31st 2023 are rewarded with a code for a Dark
                Terra type Hisuian Zoroark.</p>
