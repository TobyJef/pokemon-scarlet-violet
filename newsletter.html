                <h2>Ongoing Mightiest Mark Raid</h2>
                <h3>Rock Terra Type Chesnaught the Unrivaled</h3>
                <p>New to the Mightiest Mark raids comes Chesnaught the Unrivaled. This Grass/Fighting dual type Pokemon
                    has been given the Tera typing of Rock. As with all of the Seven Star Mightiest Mark Raids,
                    Chesnaught comes in at Level 100. Chesnaught is also rocking it's hidden ability of Bulletproof,
                    making it
                    immune to all Ball and Bomb based moves. It's already high base defence stats is also boosted by the
                    use of
                    it's turn one additional move of Iron Defence which increases psyhical defence by two stages.
                    So bringing a Fighting Type or using pyshical moves is not recommended here, as any
                    Super Effective Fighting Type moves won't deal any great amount of damage. The remainder of
                    Chesnaughts move set include Earthquake, Hammer Arm, Stone Edge and Wood Hammer. An attacking move
                    set built to counter two of it's weakness in Steel and Water types.</p>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h2>Our Strategy</h2>
                <p>We are combating this bulky Pokemon with a Modest Nature Level 100 Grass Terra Type Appletun.
                    Bred or Hyper Trained for Best IV's in all but Attack and trained for Max EV's in Special Attack
                    and Defence while holding the Shell Bell item for health recovery. With only a set of three moves
                    required of Iron Defence, Apple Acid and Giga Drain, to take down this latest Unrivaled challenger.
                </p>
                <p>Our full proof strategy to take down Chesnaught consists of a Turn One Iron Defence which we will use
                    to counter Chesnaughts physical moves. Followed by consecutive Apple Acid attacks to fully lower
                    Chesnaughts Special Defence, until we can Terrastalise our Grass type Appletun. Thanks to our high
                    Defence stats and Grass type resitance to Chesnaughts attacks and also our Shell Bell. Our tough
                    Appletun can withstand plenty of punishment from the assualting Chesnaught, so there is little risk
                    of being KO'd. Continue to either spam our Unrivaled advisary with more Apple Acid attacks or use
                    Giga Drain if your hp looks concerning for the win. A perfect raid for item farming Ability Patches
                    and Capsules, Iron suppliments also Large and XL experience candies.</p>

            <h2>The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero</h2>
            <h3>Part One - The Teal Mask - Coming Fall 2023</h3>
            <p>The Teal Mask comes as part one of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Expansion Pass. The Teal Mask
                sees your character go on a school trip to the land of Kitakami, a Japanese-inspired land which sits
                at the base of a great mountain and is full of rice paddies and apple orchards. Your trip seems to
                coincide with a festival regularly held in the village in Kitakami. The village is bustling with various
                street vendors and stalls. You’ll meet new friends and Pokémon as you unravel the mysteries behind the
                folktales that have been passed down in this land.</p>
            <h3>Part Two - The Indigo Disk - Coming Winter 2023</h3>
            <p>The Indigo Disk will have you attend the Blueberry Academy, the Naranja/Uva Academy's sister school.
                The Blueberry Academy is a relatively new school, and while there, you'll take classes and meet a whole
                host of new characters. There are a few standout features of this new school, its curriculum puts a
                particular emphasis on Pokémon battling. Most surprising of all is the fact that most of the school’s
                building is located under the ocean.</p>
