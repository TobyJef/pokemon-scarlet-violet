        <h2>Our Review</h2>
        <p>To be brief, Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, have built upon the foundations of what Pokemon Sword and
            Pokemon Shield have layed. While staying true to the main philosphy of the Pokemon games by assembling your
            team of six Pokemon through battling and catching wild Pokemon. Testing yourself against the placed
            trainer encounters, your rival, the Pokemon Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four to become Pokemon
            Champion.
            This new generation has tweaked the standard formula further bringing the series closer to the modern age
            of gaming. While some Pokemon traditionalists see these changes as disapointing because it takes the series
            further away from the earlier generation of games. We here at Pokeviews disagree with that sentiment, as the
            game franchise is fast approaching 25 years old, with the constant leaps and bounds made in the gaming
            industry
            some tweaks occasionally need to be made to help keep the series fresh. Do these changes translate
            well? No, not all of them. But at least Nintendo and Gamefreak are attempting something new.</p>
        <p>So now to our review. To help keep our review spoiler free we will not be covering the
            main story in full, but what has ben shown in the promotional trailers and the Nintendo and Pokemon Directs.
        </p>
        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Paldea, a region in the pokemon universe which is styled and inspired this time by the
            geography and culture of Spain and Portugal. The
            second consecutive European country to be chosen following Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield's unique take on
            the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>After our character creation and Pokemon series standard introduction to Pokemon and the region by the games
            Pokemon
            Professor. Our adventure begins as always in the main characters homestead. This
            time in the small and sleepy village of Cabo Poco. You soon meet the Headmaster of Pladea's main school. The
            Naranja Academy if you are playing Pokemon Scarlet, or the Uva Academy if playing Pokemon Violet. You are
            then introduced to the new starter Pokemon, your rival, then shortly afterwards the other main companion on
            your journey. This is when Scarlet and Violet departs from tradition, gone are the linear path routes from
            one village, town or city to the next. We now have a fully open rpg style world to explore and the box
            legendary as our ride mount to explore it with, and so we do just that. Our
            main in game objective though is
            to follow the path through Los Platos and continue to the Academy to begin our treasure hunt. This so called
            treasure hunt is not literal and more of a invitation to play the game and explore as you see
            fit.
            So do we follow the more traditional path of battling our way through the eight gyms and taking on the Elite
            Four? Do we undertake in another change to the main pokemon series by pursuing one of the two main side
            plots? Or explore this new region from top to bottom and dabble in the tasks at hand as and when we see fit?

        <h3>The Starter Pokemon</h3>
        <p>As with Pokemon tradition, the Pokemon starters we are introduced to at the beginning of the game are the
            standard Grass, Fire and Water types. For those that
            are still unsure of our type match ups. Fire trumps Grass, Grass trumps Water and Water trumps Fire. Our
            chose of Pokemon companions is between Sprigatito the all green Grass type Cat. Fuecoco the red and white
            Fire type bipedal Crocodile or Quaxley the Water type white duckling with a fabulous blue head of hair.
            On Pokemon Scarlet we chose Fuecoco and Quaxley on Pokemon Violet. Against the Gym Leaders Fuecoco the Fire
            type is
            by far the best suited to the type match ups with four type trumps against two disadvantages. Quaxley the
            Water type has no type advantage against any of the Gym Leaders and would be considered the more challenging
            playthrough if you were to use Quaxley and it's evolutions as your primary Pokemon to use in battle.
            With each new generation that comes out, there are a few that calls for change up in the typings of starter
            Pokemon. But with for now eighteen total types to choose from where would you begin?
        </p>
        <h3>The Open World</h3>
        <p>Our playthrough, the decision was made to explore the well sized open world around us, and get through the
            gyms and
            other tasks in no particular order or region. With vast rolling fields, open seas, jungles, mountains and
            caves to
            explore, it is too easy to spend a play session getting lost and forgetting what you set out to do.
            Simply put the Paldea region is the largest map of any Pokemon game, and we are still finding unchallenged
            static trainers to this day. The map menu feature although colourful, isn't the greatest however. Slightly
            sluggish, no filter option and a limited zoom in and out it can sometimes be hard to quickly find what
            you are looking for as even when zoomed out the map and it's icons can appear cluttered, by showing
            everything all at once of the map area you are viewing.
