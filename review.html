        <h2>Our Review</h2>
        <p>To be brief, Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, have built upon the foundations of what Pokemon Sword and
            Pokemon Shield have layed. While staying true to the main philosphy of the Pokemon games by assembling your
            team of 6 Pokemon through battling and catching wild Pokemon. Testing yourself against the placed
            trainer encounters, your rival, the Pokemon Gyms and eventually the Elite Four to become Pokemon Champion.
            This new generation has tweaked the standard formula further bringing the series closer to the modern age
            of gaming. While some Pokemon traditionalists see these changes as disapointing because it takes the series
            further away from the earlier generation of games. We here at Pokeviews disagree with that sentiment as the
            game franchise is fast approaching 25 years old, with the constant leaps and bounds made in the gaming
            industry world
            some tweaks occasionally need to be made to help keep the series fresh. Do these changes translate
            well? No not all of them, but at least Nintendo and Gamefreak are attempting something new.</p>
        <p>So now to our review. To help keep our review spoiler free we will not be covering the
            full story, but the what has shown in the promotional trailers and the Nintendo and Pokemon Directs.
        </p>
