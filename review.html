    <section>
        <h2></h2>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet while staying true to the original Pokemon formula, by assembling your
            team of six Pokemon through catching, evolution or trading. Testing yourself against your rival, the eight
            Pokemon Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four to become Pokemon
            Champion. Have built further upon the foundations of what Pokemon Sword and
            Pokemon Shield have layed to continue the evolution of main series Pokemon games into
            Generation Nine. While some Pokemon traditionalists see these changes as disapointing because it takes the
            series
            further away from the design of earlier generation of games. We here at Pokeviews disagree with that
            sentiment, as the
            game franchise is fast approaching 25 years old. With the leaps in hardware and visual capabilities each new
            generation of rival consoles make and Nintendo consoles not being the same market leaders of the 1980's
            and
            1990's, to compete against their Playstation and XBOX competitors. Nintendo focus on their best assest for
            selling consoles with their extensive list of first party games. So
            some tweaks and improvements need to be made to help keep the series fresh. Do all of these changes
            translate
            well? No, not all of them. But at least Nintendo and Gamefreak are attempting something new.</p>
        <!-- Review of the games story -->
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>Welcome to Paldea, a region in the Pokemon universe which is styled and inspired by the
            geography and culture of Spain and Portugal. The
            second consecutive European country to be chosen following Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield's unique take on
            the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>After our character creation and introduction to Pokemon and the region by the version exclusive Pokemon
            Professor. Our adventure begins as always in the main characters homestead. This
            time in the small and sleepy village of Cabo Poco. You then are introduced to the Headmaster of Pladea's
            main school. The
            Naranja Academy if you are playing Pokemon Scarlet, or the Uva Academy if playing Pokemon Violet. Afterwards
            you not only
            meet the new starter Pokemon, but also your rival Nemona, the version exclusive Legendary Pokemon Koraidon
            or Miraidon and Arven the other main companion on your journey.
        </p>
        <p>This is when Scarlet and Violet departs from tradition, gone are the linear path routes from
            one village, town or city to the next. We now have a fully open world to explore although our
            main story objective is to continue through Los Platos and towards the Academy, we cannot help but stray far
            and wide from the beaten path and see what the opening are of Paldea has to offer. After eventually making
            our way to the Academy and through the manadatory cutscenes and dialogue, we are now able to traverse the
            world with the box
            legendary as our ride mount to explore it with and through story progression Koraidon and Miraidon will gain
            abilites to Swim, Climb, Glide and Jump higher. Our main objective now, well whatever we want really. There
            are three interconnected story lines for us to follow at our choosing and in any order. Do we choose
            Nemona's story line in the quest to become regional champion? Or maybe Arven's story and follow the Path of
            Legends,
            or even take a trip towards Starfall Street to uncover the origins of Team Star and dismantle this
            troublesome group.</p>
        <p> Whilst Victory Road story arc is not breaking any new ground, the Path of Legends is surprisingly touching
            and Starfall Street is a pleasant enough experience though slightly repetative. Overall the complete story
            is one of the stronger entries into the franchise.

        <h3>The Starter Pokemon</h3>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>As with Pokemon tradition, the Pokemon starters we are introduced to at the beginning of the game are the
            standard Grass, Fire and Water types. For those that
            are still unsure of basic type match ups. Fire trumps Grass, Grass trumps Water and Water trumps Fire. Our
            choice of Pokemon companions is between Sprigatito the green Grass type Cat. Fuecoco the red bipedal Fire
            type Crocodile or Quaxley the Water type white duckling with a bouyant blue hair do.</p>
        <p>
            On Pokemon Scarlet we picked Fuecoco and Quaxley on Pokemon Violet. After checking the type
            match ups of all three starters and their evolution lines, against the Gym Leaders and Elite Four members
            Fuecoco with it's Fire typing is
            by far the best suited to take advantage of the upcoming type match ups. Quaxley and it's Water type has no
            type advantage against any of the eight Gym Leaders and could be considered for a more
            challenging playthrough.</p>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <!-- New battle mechanic review -->
        <h3>Terrastalisation</h3>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p> In Pokemon Scarlet and Violet the new battle feature is the Terrastalise ability. Similar to gimmics
            from previous generations like Mega Evolutions and Dynamax ablities, this once per battle one Pokemon
            ability
            will transform your Pokemon to something that looks like it's from the Swarovski catalogue, and adds
            additional
            damage to moves of the same Terra type. Each Pokemon's own Terra type is based on it's typing. So single
            type Pokemon such as a wild Drowzee will always be the given Psychic Terra type ability. Dual type pokemon
            such as Tyranitar when caught in the wild will be asigned with either a Dark or Rock Terra type. You can
            find rare glistening Pokemon throughout the open world that will have a set randomised Terra type from it's
            normal typing. But through
            story progression
            the ability to change the Terra type of your Pokemon is unlocked, potentially giving you a key edge in
            battle if
            competitve play is your thing or a particular type advantage when participating in the Terra raid dens.
        </p>
        <!-- Thoughts on the in game world -->
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <h3>The Open World</h3>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>During our first playthrough the decision was made to first explore the well sized open world around us, and
            progress through the story lines no particular order. With vast rolling fields, open seas, jungles,
            mountains and
            caves to explore, it is all too easy to spend your play session getting lost and forgetting what you
            initially set out to do.
            Simply put the Paldea region is the largest map of any Pokemon game, and we are still finding unchallenged
            static trainers to this day. The map menu feature although colourful, isn't the greatest however. Slightly
            sluggish, no filter option and a limited zoom in and out it can sometimes be hard to quickly find what
            you are looking for as even when zoomed out the map and it's icons can appear cluttered, by showing
            everything all at once on the part of the map area you are viewing. The size of the map is set to increase
            even further when the upcoming paid additional content of The Treasure of Area Zero is fully released.

    <section>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <h3>Gym Battles and Gym Challenges</h3>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>So the basic of Gym Battles remain intact. Defeat the Gym Leader and their team of preffered type Pokemon and
            recieve a badge. To be able to earn the opportunity to battle a
            Gym Leader however, players have to defeat the Gym Challenge first. To be honest, these challenges were a
            bit of
            a miss. At best these challenges are just a mini game. At worst it feels like content just to
            pad out the run time of the game.
            Ever fancied kicking a giant inflatable olive around an obstacle course and into an open goal under a time
            limit? No? Well too bad because you without it you can't progress your game. Sorry.
        </p>
        <p>Once you suffer through the Gym Challenge and take on it's Leader, it's business as usual until the Gym
            Leader is down to their final Pokemon. Their chosen signature Pokemon is not what you expect as the
            Pokemon's typing does not conform with the rest of the Leaders team, presenting you with initally a
            surprise. However they will Terrastalise their Pokemon from it's base type, to the
            Gym Leaders preffered typing. The first few times this happen did through us, as squaring off against a Rock
            Type in Sudowoodo in Bug Gym is not par for the course, and instinct tricks you into wanting to switch
            Pokemon. However once realising that the typing has now changed
            from Rock to Grass, it's back to battling with confidence. A interesting new feature
            to add but one that could of maybe used more though to add a bit more of a challenge to the Gym Leader
            experience.</p>

    <section>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>The games performance is one the most documented disapointing aspects of this generation. From
            game breaking bugs one recently as of May 2023, prompted the latest Terra
            Spotlight event to be cancelled and a apology statement being issued. There are multiple reported issues of
            the game
            crashing, save corruption, players falling through the world floor and Terra raid battles. Lists of issues
            seem to go on and on, and with a strange lack of patches being issued to help fix
            some of the bugs, it is
            not a good look from those involved at Nintendo and Gamefreak and they must do better with the development
            and release
            of Generation 10.</p>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <h4>The Visuals</h4>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>Visually the game is a bit of mixed bag, some views and biomes are quite well presented, while other assets
            have
            issues with textures and pop ins. The games mostly runs smoothly, but their are instances of frame rates
            dropping to near what can be described as single digits, a issue also encountered in Pokemon Legends Arceus.
            Also during Union Circle sessions where any more than two people playing can cause the game
            to really struggle. On a positive some Pokemon
            attack animation can be considered a step forward, but the
            majority is nothing new, and the combat style is a step backwards when compared to the Pokemon battles from
            Pokemon Legends Arceus.</p>
        <!-- Review Summary -->
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <h3>Our final thoughts</h3>
        <p class="text-spacing"></p>
        <p>Overall, Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet is a good entry into the Pokemon mains series
            franchise and we loved our playthroughs and continue to enjoy the game after completion of the post game.
            The difficulty of the Six and Seven star Terra raids keep us on our toes by giving new type match up
            problems to solve and how to
            best our opponent, making victory all the more satisfying. Warts and all we would recommend to any fan that
            they pick up a copy at some point and see what this generation has to offer.</p>
        <p>
            However, in the idea of fairness. Generation Nine had multiple issues reported at launch and continues to do
            so
            now. It is
            debatable on where blame can be placed. Both the game at release and in it's current state is
            clearly missing some polish and could of benefited for another six to twelve months of development. Is
            there an argument to be had that some of the issues Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have encountered is
            down to the running capabilities on all variations of the Nintendo Switch and with the console nearing the
            end of it's life cycle. Could a decision of been made to hold back the release of Generation Nine and use it
            as a flag ship release title for a next generation Nintnedo console? Although when comparing Scarlet and
            Violet to the
            recent release The Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom. A game that had
            been announced and held back until it was deemed finished and acceptable to be released. Has rewarded fans
            of
            the series with another visually stunning game and another game of the year contender.</p>
        <p>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet could of been a Pokemon game above all the rest, to set a new bar for what
            the franchise and provide a Pokemon experience like no other. However due to the games many issues, more of
            the same old questions and concerns are raised. Our hopes for the future of the franchise is to truly take
            note of the fair cristicism Scarlet and Violet face. But to continue to build on what as worked well and
            with Generation 10 or whatever else is planned for Pokemon, most likely making it's debut on the next
            generation of Nintendo Console. Proper time can be taking to truly make a Pokemon game that only the fans
            can dream of.</p>
