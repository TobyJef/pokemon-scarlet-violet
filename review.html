            <h2>Our Review</h2>
            <h3>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, I Choose You!</h3>
            <p>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet while staying true to the original Pokemon formula, by assembling
                your team of six Pokemon through catching, evolution or trading. Testing your skills against your
                rival, the Eight Pokemon Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four to become Pokemon Champion.
                Have again built further upon the foundations of what Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield have layed,
                to continue the evolution of main series Pokemon games into Generation Nine.
                While some Pokemon traditionalists see these changes as disapointing because it takes
                the series further away from the design of earlier generation of games. We here at Pokeviews
                disagree with that sentiment, as the game franchise is fast approaching 25 years old. With the leaps
                in hardware and visual capabilities of each new generation of rival consoles and Nintendo hardware
                not being the market leader it was of the 1980's and 1990's. To continue competing against their
                Playstation and Xbox competitors, Nintendo must focus on their best assest, their extensive list of
                first party games. So some tweaks and improvements need to be made to help keep the series fresh. Do
                all of these changes translate well? No, not all of them. But at least Nintendo and Gamefreak are
                attempting something new.

        <div class="review-box">
            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Paldea, a region in the Pokemon universe which is styled and inspired by the
                geography and culture of Spain and Portugal. The second consecutive European country to be chosen
                following Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield's unique take on the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>After our character creation and introduction to Pokemon and the region by the version exclusive
                Pokemon Professor. Professor Sada on Scarlet and Professor Turo on Violet. Our adventure begins as
                always in the main characters homestead. This time in the small and sleepy village of Cabo Poco.
                You then are introduced to Director Clavell, the Headmaster of Pladea's Academy. You will be
                attending the Naranja Academy if you are playing Pokemon Scarlet, or the Uva Academy if playing
                Pokemon Violet. Afterwards you not only meet the new starter Pokemon, but also your rival Nemona,
                the version exclusive Legendary Pokemon Koraidon or Miraidon and Arven the other main companion on
                your journey.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="under-image-text main-text">
            <p>This is when Scarlet and Violet departs from tradition, gone are the linear path routes from
                one village, town or city to the next. We now have a fully open world to explore although our
                main story objective is to continue through Los Platos and towards the Academy, we cannot help but
                stray far and wide from the beaten path and see what the opening are of Paldea has to offer.</p>
            <p>After eventually making our way to the Academy in Mesagoza and through the manadatory cutscenes and
                dialogue, we are now able to traverse the world with the legendary Pokemon as our ride mount.
                To aid the exploration, through story progression Koraidon and Miraidon will gain abilites to Swim,
                Climb, Glide and Jump higher. Our main objective for now however, well whatever we want really.
                There are three interconnected story lines for us to follow at our choosing and in any order. Do we
                choose Nemona's story line in the quest to become regional champion? Or maybe Arven's story and
                follow the Path of Legends, or even take a trip down Starfall Street to uncover the origins of Team
                Star and dismantle this troublesome group.</p>
            <p> Whilst Victory Road story arc is not breaking any new ground, the Path of Legends is surprisingly
                touching and Starfall Street is a pleasant enough experience though slightly repetative. Overall the
                complete story is one of the stronger entries into the franchise.</p>

                <h3>The Starter Pokemon</h3>
                <p>As with Pokemon tradition, the Pokemon starters we are introduced to at the beginning of the game are
                    the standard Grass, Fire and Water types. For those that are still unsure of basic type match ups.
                    Fire trumps Grass, Grass trumps Water and Water trumps Fire. Our choice of Pokemon companions is
                    between Sprigatito the green Grass type Cat. Fuecoco the red bipedal Fire type Crocodile or Quaxly
                    the Water type white feathered duckling with a bouyant blue hair do.</p>
                <p> On Pokemon Scarlet we picked Fuecoco and Quaxly on Pokemon Violet. After checking the type match
                    ups of all three starters and their evolution lines, against the Gym Leaders and Elite Four members
                    Fuecoco with it's Fire typing is by far the best suited to take advantage of the upcoming type match
                    ups. Quaxly and it's Water type has no type advantage against any of the eight Gym Leaders and could
                    be considered for a more challenging playthrough.</p>
                <!-- Thoughts on the in game world -->
                <h3>The Open World</h3>
                <p>During our first playthrough the decision was made to first explore the well sized open world around
                    us, and progress through the story lines no particular order. With vast rolling fields, open seas,
                    jungles, mountains and caves to explore. It is all too easy to spend your play session getting lost
                    and forgetting what you initially set out to do. Simply put the Paldea region is the largest map of
                    any Pokemon game, and we are still finding unchallenged static trainers to this day.
                    The map menu feature although colourful, isn't the greatest however. Slightly sluggish,
                    no filter option with a limited zoom in and out it can sometimes be hard to quickly find
                    what you are looking for as even when zoomed out the map and it's icons can appear cluttered,
                    by showing everything all at once on the part of the map area you are viewing. The size of the map
                    is speculated to increase further when the upcoming paid additional content of The Treasure of Area
                    Zero is fully released.</p>

            <div class="tauros-box tauros-text">
                <h3>Terastallization</h3>
                <p> In Pokemon Scarlet and Violet the new battle feature is the Terastalize ability. Similar to gimmics
                    from previous generations like Mega Evolutions and Dynamax ablities, this once per battle one
                    Pokemon ability will transform your Pokemon to something that looks like it's from the Swarovski
                    catalogue, and adds additional damage to moves of the same Trra type. Each Pokemon's own Tera type
                    is based on it's typing. So single type Pokemon such as a wild Drowzee will always be the given
                    Psychic Tera type ability. Dual type pokemon such as Tyranitar when caught in the wild will be
                    assigned with either a Dark or Rock Tera type. You can find rare glistening Pokemon throughout
                    the open world that will have a set randomised Tera type from it's normal typing. But through
                    story progression the ability to change the Tera type of your Pokemon is unlocked, potentially
                    giving you a key edge in battle if competitve play is your thing or a particular type advantage
                    when participating in Tera raid dens.</p>

            <!-- review of the games perfomance and visuals -->
            <div id="end-content">
                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <p>The games performance is one the most documented disapointing aspects of this generation. From
                    game breaking bugs one recently as of May 2023, prompted the latest Tera Spotlight event to be
                    cancelled and a apology statement being issued. There are multiple reported issues of the game
                    crashing, save corruption, players falling through the world floor and Tera raid battles. Lists of
                    issues seem to go on and on, and with a strange lack of patches being issued to help fix
                    some of the bugs, it is not a good look from those involved at Nintendo and Gamefreak and they
                    must do better with the development and release of Generation 10.</p>
                <h3>The Visuals</h3>
                <p>Visually the game is a bit of mixed bag, some views and biomes are quite well presented, while other
                    assets have issues with textures and pop ins. The games mostly runs smoothly, but their are
                    instances of frame rates dropping to near what can be described as single digits, a issue also
                    encountered in Pokemon Legends Arceus. Also during Union Circle sessions where any more than two
                    people playing can cause the game to really struggle. On a positive some Pokemon attack animation
                    can be considered a step forward, but the majority is nothing new, and the combat style is a step
                    backwards when compared again to the formally mentioned Pokemon Legends Arceus.</p>
                <!-- Review Summary -->
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Overall, Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet is a good entry into the Pokemon mains series
                    franchise and we loved our playthroughs and continue to enjoy the game after completion of the post
                    game. The difficulty of the Six and Seven star Tera raids keep us on our toes by giving new type
                    match up problems to solve and how to best our opponent, making victory all the more satisfying.
                    Warts and all we would recommend to any fan that they pick up a copy at some point and see what this
                    generation has to offer.</p>
                <p> However, in the idea of fairness. Generation Nine had multiple issues reported at launch and
                    continues to do so now. It is debatable on where blame can be placed. Both the game at release and
                    in it's current state is clearly missing some polish and could of benefited for another six to
                    twelve months of development. Is there an argument to be had that some of the issues Pokemon Scarlet
                    and Violet have encountered is down to the running capabilities on all variations of the Nintendo
                    Switch and with the console nearing the end of it's life cycle. Could a decision of been made to
                    hold back the release of Generation Nine and use it as a flag ship release title for a next
                    generation Nintnedo console? Although when comparing Scarlet and Violet to the recent release The
                    Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom. A game that had been announced and held back until it was
                    deemed finished and acceptable to be released. Which has rewarded fans of the series with another
                    visually stunning game and another game of the year contender.</p>
                <p>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet could of been a Pokemon game above all the rest, to set a new bar
                    for what the franchise and provide a Pokemon experience like no other. However due to the games many
                    issues, more of the same old questions and concerns are raised. Our hopes for the future of the
                    franchise is to truly take note of the fair cristicism Scarlet and Violet face. But to continue to
                    build on what has worked well and with Generation 10 or whatever else is planned for Pokemon, most
                    likely making it's debut on the next generation of Nintendo Console. Proper time can be taking to
                    truly make a Pokemon game that only the fans can dream of.</p>
