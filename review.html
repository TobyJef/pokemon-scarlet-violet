        <h2>Our Review</h2>
        <p>To be brief, Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, have built upon the foundations of what Pokemon Sword and
            Pokemon Shield have layed. While staying true to the main philosphy of the Pokemon games by assembling your
            team of six Pokemon through battling and catching wild Pokemon. Testing yourself against the placed
            trainer encounters, your rival, the Pokemon Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four to become Pokemon
            Champion.
            This new generation has tweaked the standard formula further bringing the series closer to the modern age
            of gaming. While some Pokemon traditionalists see these changes as disapointing because it takes the series
            further away from the earlier generation of games. We here at Pokeviews disagree with that sentiment, as the
            game franchise is fast approaching 25 years old, with the constant leaps and bounds made in the gaming
            industry
            some tweaks occasionally need to be made to help keep the series fresh. Do these changes translate
            well? No, not all of them. But at least Nintendo and Gamefreak are attempting something new.</p>
        <p>To help keep our review spoiler free we will not be covering the
            main story in full, but what has ben shown in the promotional trailers and from the Nintendo and Pokemon
            Directs.
            The generation exclusive main new battle feature is the Terrastalise ability. Similar to gimmics from
            previous generations like Mega Evolutions and Dynamax this once per battle for one Pokemon only ability will
            transform your Pokemon to something that looks like it's from the Swarovski catalogue, and add additional
            damage to moves of the same Terra type. Every Pokemon has a natural Terra type of it's own, which will be
            whatever singular typing your Pokemon has or one of two type's if a Pokemon has duel typing. For example
            Gyarados will at random be given either a Water Terra type or a Flying Terra type. However these typings are
            not set in stone and through collection of Terra shards and story progression you will unlock the ability to
            change the Terra type of your Pokemon, potentially giving you a key edge in battle if competitve play is
            your thing.
        </p>
        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Paldea, a region in the pokemon universe which is styled and inspired this time by the
            geography and culture of Spain and Portugal. The
            second consecutive European country to be chosen following Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield's unique take on
            the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>After our character creation and Pokemon series standard introduction to Pokemon and the region by the games
            Pokemon
            Professor. Our adventure begins as always in the main characters homestead. This
            time in the small and sleepy village of Cabo Poco. You soon meet the Headmaster of Pladea's main school. The
            Naranja Academy if you are playing Pokemon Scarlet, or the Uva Academy if playing Pokemon Violet. You are
            then introduced to the new starter Pokemon, your rival, then shortly afterwards the other main companion on
            your journey. This is when Scarlet and Violet departs from tradition, gone are the linear path routes from
            one village, town or city to the next. We now have a fully open rpg style world to explore and the box
            legendary as our ride mount to explore it with, and so we do just that. Our
            main in game objective though is
            to follow the path through Los Platos and continue to the Academy to begin our treasure hunt. This so called
            treasure hunt is not literal and more of a invitation to play the game and explore as you see
            fit.
            So do we follow the more traditional path of battling our way through the eight gyms and taking on the Elite
            Four? Do we undertake in another change to the main pokemon series by pursuing one of the two main side
            plots? Or explore this new region from top to bottom and dabble in the tasks at hand as and when we see fit?
        </p>

        <h3>The Starter Pokemon</h3>
        <p>As with Pokemon tradition, the Pokemon starters we are introduced to at the beginning of the game are the
            standard Grass, Fire and Water types. For those that
            are still unsure of our type match ups. Fire trumps Grass, Grass trumps Water and Water trumps Fire. Our
            chose of Pokemon companions is between Sprigatito the all green Grass type Cat. Fuecoco the red and white
            Fire type bipedal Crocodile or Quaxley the Water type white duckling with a fabulous blue head of hair.
            On Pokemon Scarlet we chose Fuecoco and Quaxley on Pokemon Violet respectively. After checking the type
            match ups of all three starter evolution lines, against the Gym Leaders and certain Elite Four members
            Fuecoco the Fire
            type is
            by far the best suited to take advantage of the type match ups, while Quaxley the
            Water type has no type advantage against any of the eight Gym Leaders and would be considered the more
            challenging
            playthrough if you were to use Quaxley and it's evolutions as your primary Pokemon. When considering the
            designs of the new starter Pokemon, our opinion is that Sprigatito is possibly the weakest of the design
            choices as it is nothing more than a green cat, and struggles to bring a sense of character with it. Fuecoco
            and Quaxley do appear to have had more thought both put into their designs do bring a sense of mischeif and
            arrogance. We won't spoil the the middle and final evolutions but there is definetely a case for the less to
            be said about two of them the better. However that is our opinion and they say beauty is in the eye of the
            beholder, so who are we to judge.
            With each new generation that comes out, there are a few that calls for change up in the typings of starter
            Pokemon. But with for now eighteen total types to choose from where would you begin? Although I do
            understand part of that argument, I believe this is one main line series standard that should not be
            tampered with.
        </p>
        <h3>Version Differences</h3>
        <p>As usual first off the bat in terms of the difference between Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet, each game
            has it's version exclusive Pokemon which is to continue one of the original core mechanics of Pokemon in
            catching them all and trading those you can't with your mates. Each game having 24 Pokemon the other cannot
            obtain on their own naturally through their adventure. These include the Legendary Pokemon that appear on
            the front of
            each game. Koraidon in Scarlet and Miraidon in Violet. There are 14 Pokemon on each game that can be caught
            in the wild, one trade evolution each and seven Pokemon each that can be found later on exclusively in the
            near end game. There is also an exclusive timed raid event Pokemon for each game, with Scarlet recieving the
            Walking Wake raid and Violet recieving the Iron Leaves raid. Both classed as Five Star Raids, these Pokemon
            are a signficant challenge, even harder than some Six Star Terra raids and are both accessible to each game
            through joining hosted online games of the
            opposite version.</p>
        <p>Finally with
            the return of the Global Trading System and the Suprise Trade function it can be
            a fun way to try and fill your Pokedex by trying your luck and sending one of your own Pokemon into the
            ether and to see what returns in your favour. You may get lucky and recieve a Pokemon you need or a Magikarp
            that the Original Trainer no longer needed. It's a complete lottery</p>
        <p>The only other differences to mention depending on your version of the game is the name of the Academy, the
            colour and style of the school uniforms and the Pokemon Professor's which is a new addition. Unfortunately
            having a version exclusive Gym Leader like in Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield have not made a return for
            this generation.</p>
        <h3>The Open World</h3>
        <p>For our playthrough, the decision was made to explore the well sized open world around us, and get through
            the
            gyms and
            other tasks in no particular order. With vast rolling fields, open seas, jungles, mountains and
            caves to
            explore, it is too easy to spend a play session getting lost and forgetting what you set out to do.
            Simply put the Paldea region is the largest map of any Pokemon game, and we are still finding unchallenged
            static trainers to this day. The map menu feature although colourful, isn't the greatest however. Slightly
            sluggish, no filter option and a limited zoom in and out it can sometimes be hard to quickly find what
            you are looking for as even when zoomed out the map and it's icons can appear cluttered, by showing
            everything all at once on the part of the map area you are viewing.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Gym Battles and Gym Challenges</h3>
        <p>So the basic of Gym Battles remain intact. Defeat the Gym Leader and their team of preffered type Pokemon and
            recieve a badge. That is where the familiarity ends. To now be able to earn the opportunity to battle a
            Gym Leader. Players now have to defeat the Gym Challenge first. To be honest, these challenges were a bit of
            a miss. At best they can be described as a mini game. Outside of that it feels more like added content to
            pad out the run time of the game and an experience that was wanted to be over with as soon as possible.
            Ever wanted to kick a giant inflatable olive around an obstacle course and then kick said inflatable olive
            into an open goal under a time limit? No? Well ever wanted to that exact challenge but in a game? No, still?
            Well too bad because without it you can't progress your game. Sorry.
        </p>
        <p>Once you suffer through the Gym Challenges and take on the leader, we do get to experience the key battle
            gimmic that every new generation has. Once the Gym Leader is down to their final and signature Pokemon they
            will start by Terrastalising the Pokemon from it's base type to the Gym's preffered typing. However after
            the first few gyms and seeing Gym Leaders change their signature Pokemon of not traditional typing change
            into the typing you've already been
            despatching with ease, the new feature looses a bit of it's interest as you can continue the battle as
            normal and pressing the A button on your strongest Super Effective attack to win. An interesting new feature
            to add but one that could of maybe used more though to add a bit more of a challenge to the Gym Leader
            experience, although a criticism and that has already done the rounds from previous games.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Terra Raids</h3>
        <p>One aspect where Terrastalised Pokemon does hit home is in the new Terra raids. One of the built upon
            features from Pokemon Sword and Shield, the Terra raid battles add to most of Scarlet and Violet's
            replayability for after the end credits have rolled. The raids range in difficulty from One to Six stars
            with time exclusive Seven star raids which introduce returning Pokemon that were not included in the base
            game. One star raids are perfect for new players and the daily Six star raids are for those trainers looking
            for a challenge. Where these raids shine is the chance to take on Pokemon with typings that are not its own
            and making you think more on not only your Pokemons strength and weaknesses but that of the Raid Pokemon
            also.</p>
        <p>
            These raids can be attempted by yourself or with a group of friends or randomly grouped strangers online. We
            do recommend however, that for the higher star raids you have a decent understanding on Pokemon IV's
            (Individual values) and EV's (Effort values) there are plenty of great resources online and on Youtube on
            this subject, and that your Pokemon are level 100 to give your team and yourself the best chance of success.
            However if you do find yourself struggling to come out on top remember to sign up to our newsletter as we
            cover the best strategies and Pokemon builds to bring along.</p>
        <h3>Picnics and Union Circle</h3>
        <h4>Sandwiches and more</h4>
        <p>Picnics are the Paldean variation to Sword and Shields camping and cooking mechanic. Picnics are primarily
            used for two things. First is breeding, gone are the days at dropping two Pokemon off at the Pokemon Day
            care for the purpose of breeding Pokemon eggs. Either to breed eggs of fully evolved Pokemon down to their
            stage
            one forms to fill gaps in the Pokedex or to breed your way to Pokemon genetic supremecy and the coverted Six
            Best IV's and preffered nature or the rare chance of hatching a shiny Pokemon. However with Hyper training
            and the use of mints to alter a Pokemons nature,
            breeding prefection for personal or competitive use is no longer the only way. Providing you in game wallet
            is deep enough.</p>
        <p>Purpose number two of the picnics is the new sandwich builder mechanic. Follow along your favourite in game
            recipe, place down the bread and layer on the toppings and finishing off the sandwich with a pick, to unlock
            a thirty minute game play boost. Want a better egg appearance and hatch rate? Make the Jam Sandwich. Want to
            encounter more Normal type Pokemon? Make the Fruit Sandwich. Each sandwich and it's fillings provided
            different boosts and at different levels, up to Level Three. With the more rare and expensive ingredients
            providing the better boosts. You can also purchase sandwiches and meals from different vendors around Paldea
            that can provide you with your desired boost. Although these boosts can only achieve up to Level Two, which
            can be enough for what you need, such as when breeding Pokemon during a picnic.</p>
        <h4>Union Circle</h4>
        <p>A fun yet flawed new feature, the Union Circle is a first for the Pokemon franchise and allows
            you and up to three friends all to gather into the same game at the same time while online. Roam the Paldea
            region together and if you are playing with a friend with the opposite version to yourself take turns
            setting the pace and encounter the exclusive Pokemon to each game. Don't forget to bring along a Level 28
            Palafin along and level up again to perform the Union Circle exclusive evolution. The flaws however in this
            unique feature do not take long to appear. The first being that if you want to explore Area Zero together,
            communication between those involved is key, as the players involved in the Union Circle will no longer be
            visible to the party or yourself. So good luck trying to follow one another without any open dialogue.
            Continuing from this point, if the party is not together, then the benefit of gaining access to version
            exclusive Pokemon is lost until you find each other. We will cover the final point in our final thoughts
            section.</p>

        <h3>Review Breakdown</h3>
        <h4>Performance</h4>
        <p>The games performance is one the most documented disapointing aspects of this generation. From
            two seperate instances of game breaking bugs, one within the month of May 2023, prompting the latest Terra
            Spotlight event to be cancelled and a statement being issued. There is multiple reported issues of the game
            crashing, players falling through the world, issues within the Terra raid battles themsleves. The list of
            issues seem to go on and on, and a strange lack of patches being issued to help repair it's problems, it is
            not a
            good look from those involved and they must do better when Generation 10 is released.</p>
        <h4>The Visuals</h4>
        <p>Visually the game is a bit of mixed bag, some views and biomes are quite well presented, while others have
            issues with loading textures and pop ins. The games mostly runs smoothly, but frame rates of distance
            Pokemon drop through the floor to what can be described as single digit frames per second, a issue also
            encountered in Pokemon Legends Arceus. This also
            includes frame rate drops during Union Circle sessions where any more than two people playing cause the game
            to really struggle. Some Pokemon
            attack animation can be considered a step forward, but the
            majority is nothing new, and the combat style is a step backwards compared to the more realistic
            visualisation of Pokemon battles on Pokemon Legends Arceus.</p>
        <h4>The Story</h4>
        <p>Actually a stronger point for Scarlet and Violet, not nessecarily a story that is going to win any awards.
            But more engaging than the tired story line of bad people exist, bad people plan to do bad things, player
            stops head bad persons grand plan. The companions are realised well and each have an individual impact on
            the overall story.</p>
        <h3>Our final thoughts</h3>
        <p>Long review short. Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet are good entries into the Pokemon mains series
            franchise and we loved our playthroughs and continue to enjoy the game after completion of the post game.
            The added difficulty of the Terra raids keep us on our toes and give us new problems to solve and how to
            best our opponent, making victory all the more satisfying.
            However, and a big however Generation Nine had multiple issues at launch and continues to do so now. It is
            debatable on where blame can be placed or absolved. Are Gamefreak at fault for releasing a unfinished game
            that is
            clearly missing some polish and could of benefited for another six to twelve months of development. Or is
            there an argument to be had that the reasons Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have encountered these issues is
            because the
            Nintendo Switch is nearing the end of it's life cycle, and what was seen as ageing hardware upon the
            Switch's release it is now harder than ever to release a game that meets the standards of todays gamers and
            fans of the series. Although I do find that hard to believe that line of reasoning, when compared to the
            recent release of the new entry of The Legend of Zelda series, with Tears of the Kingdom. A game that had
            been announced and held back again and again until it was considered fully finished. Yet rewarded fans of
            the series with
            another visually stunning game and another game of the year contender onto to the same ageing hardware.</p>
        <p>Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet could of been a Pokemon game above all the rest, and set the
            standard of what a great Pokemon game can be. However due to the games many issues, more of the same old
            questions and concerns are raised. It is somewhat comparable to state of the release of Cyperpunk 2077
            back in 2020, however Pokemon was just about not as much of a hot mess on release and seemed to escape a
            similar backlash. Our hopes for the future of the franchise is to truly take note of the fair cristicism
            made
            regarding Scarlet and Violet. Continue to build on what as worked well and with the high likely hood of
            Generation 10 making it's debut on the next generation of Nintendo Console, the time can be taking to truly
            make a Pokemon game that looks stunning, runs flawlessly and brings something that helps new life into this
            franchise.</p>
