            <!-- Overview of features and version difference -->
            <h2>New Features</h2>
            <p>With a new generation of Pokemon comes new species of Pokemon, new regional forms, and new features.
                There are some returning but altered features from previous main series or spin off titles to fit
                the new design of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. The biggest of these newest features come in the form
                on a fully open world map allowing full player freedom for exploration. </p>
            <p>The introduction of The Union Circle allows for up to four players the chance join up and share their
                Pokemon adventure together. Then there is the new Tera Raid dens, a built upon feature from the
                raids of Pokemon Sword and Shield. Test your type match up knowledge by challenging Pokemon that
                have a different base type to what you already know. Essentially creating the first tri
                typed Pokemon.</p>
            <p>Smaller differences to mention depending on your version of the game, include the Academy name
                Naranja/Uva, the colour and style of the school uniforms, red accented uniforms for Scarlet and blue
                for Violet. Your Pokemon Professors will also be determined by what version you play which is a
                never before seen addition. The paradox Pokemon will vary also, will a preference for prehistoric or
                futuristic sway your choice? Unfortunately missing out for this generation is version exclusive Gym
                Leaders like in Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield which have not made a return.</p>

        <!-- Review of the Open World and Gym Battles -->
        <section class="main-text">
            <div>
                <h3>The Open World</h3>
                <p>For our playthrough, the decision was made to explore the well sized open world around us, and get
                    through the gyms and other over arching story lines in no particular order. With vast rolling
                    fields, open seas, jungles, mountains and caves to explore, it is far too easy to spend your play
                    session in getting lost and forgetting what you set out to do. Simply put the Paldea region is the
                    largest map of any Pokemon game. We are still finding unchallenged static trainers to this day. The
                    map although colourful, isn't the greatest however. Slightly sluggish to move through, no filter
                    options and only four stages of a limited zoom it can make it difficult to quickly find what you are
                    looking for.</p>
            </div>

        <section class="main-text">
            <div>
                <h3>Gym Battles and Gym Challenges</h3>
                <p>So the basic of Gym Battles remain intact. Defeat the Gym Leader and their team of preffered type
                    Pokemon and recieve a badge. To be able to earn the opportunity to battle a Gym Leader however,
                    players have to defeat the Gym Challenge first. To be honest, these challenges were a bit of
                    a miss. At best these challenges are just a mini game. At worst it feels like content just to
                    pad out the run time of the game. Ever fancied kicking a giant inflatable olive around an obstacle
                    course and into an open goal under a time limit? No? Well too bad because you without it you can't
                    progress your game. Sorry.</p>
                <p>Once you suffer through the Gym Challenge and take on it's Leader, it's business as usual until the
                    Gym Leader is down to their final Pokemon. Their chosen signature Pokemon is not what you expect as
                    the Pokemon's typing does not conform with the rest of the Leaders team, presenting you with
                    initally a surprise. However they will Terastalize their Pokemon from it's base type, to the Gym
                    Leaders preffered typing. The first few times this happen did through us, as squaring off against
                    a Rock Type in Sudowoodo in a Grass Gym is not par for the course, and instinct tricks you into
                    wanting to switch Pokemon. However once realising that the typing has now changed from Rock to
                    Grass, it's back to battling with confidence. A interesting new feature to add but one that could
                    of maybe used more though to add a bit more of a challenge to the Gym Leader experience.</p>

        <!-- Version exclusive Pokemon -->
        <section class="main-text">
            <div id="exclusive-text-middle">
                <h3>Exclusive Pokemon</h3>
                <p>As always each game has it's version exclusive Pokemon. In Scarlet and Violet within each edition
                    there are 24 version exclusive Pokemon. These include the Legendary Pokemon that appear on
                    the front cover of each game. Koraidon will be found in Scarlet and Miraidon in Violet.</p>
                <p>There are 14 exclusive wild Pokemon, One trade evolution and Seven Paradox Pokemon that can be found
                    later in Area Zero near the end of the story.
                    There has already been an version exclusive limited timed raid event Pokemon for each game, Scarlet
                    recieving Walking Wake and Violet recieving Iron Leaves. Rated as Five Star Raids, these Tera
                    raids were a signficant challenge, even tougher than some Six Star Tera raids. Both raids were
                    accessible to each game through joining hosted online raids from the opposite version.</p>
                <p>To fully fill your Pokedex with the 400 Pokemon available in the game and get your hands on that
                    sought after shiny charm. You will be required to either trade for those Pokemon unobtainable to
                    your version, try your luck with a mystery trade or perhaps join an online tera raid party.</p>

            <div id="exclusive-text-bottom">
                <h3>Tera Raids</h3>
                <p>One aspect where Terastalised Pokemon does hit home is in the new Tera raid battles. One of the
                    built upon features from Pokemon Sword and Shield. The Tera raids add the most to Scarlet and
                    Violet's replayability for after the end credits have rolled. The raids range in difficulty from
                    One to Six stars with time exclusive Seven star raids which gradually introduce returning Pokemon
                    that were not included in the base game. One star raids are perfect for new players and the
                    daily Six star raids are for those trainers looking for a challenge.
                    Where these raids shine is the chance to take on Pokemon with typings that are
                    not its own, making you think more on not only your Pokemons strength and weaknesses but that
                    of the Raid Pokemon also.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-text">
            <div id="under-image-text">
                <p>These raids can be attempted by yourself or with a group of friends or fellow online
                    players. We do recommend to follow the general advice to give your team and yourself the best
                    chance of success. Which is to raise your Pokemon to level 100, fully EV trained with items or the
                    traditional way and that the Pokemon IV's are either Best or Hyper Trained. If you struggle with
                    understanding the difference between your Pokemon IV's (Individual values) and EV's
                    (Effort values) there are plenty of great resources online on this subject.
                    However if you do find yourself struggling to come out on top remember to sign up to our
                    newsletter as we cover the best strategies and Pokemon builds to bring along.</p>

                <h3>Picnics and Union Circle</h3>
                <h4>Sandwiches and more</h4>
                <p>Picnics are the Paldean variation to Sword and Shields camping and cooking mechanic. Picnics are
                    primarily used for two things. First is breeding, gone are the days at dropping two Pokemon off
                    at the Pokemon Day care for the purpose of breeding Pokemon eggs. Either to breed eggs of fully
                    evolved Pokemon down to their stage one forms to fill gaps in the Pokedex or to breed your way
                    to Pokemon genetic supremecy and the coverted Six Best IV's and preffered nature or the rare
                    chance of hatching a shiny Pokemon. However with Hyper training, mints to alter Pokemons natures,
                    or suppliments. Breeding to prefection for personal or competitive use is no longer the only way.
                    Providing your in game wallet is deep enough.</p>
                <p>Purpose number two of the picnics is the new sandwich builder mechanic. Follow along your favourite
                    in game recipe, place down the bread and layer on the toppings and finishing off the sandwich with
                    a pick, to unlock a thirty minute game play boost. Want a better egg appearance and hatch rate?
                    Make the Jam Sandwich. Want to encounter more Normal type Pokemon? Make the Fruit Sandwich.
                    Each sandwich and it's fillings provided different boosts and at different levels, up to Level
                    Three. With the more rare and expensive ingredients providing the better boosts.
                    You can also purchase sandwiches and meals from different vendors around Paldea that can
                    provide you with your desired boost. Although these boosts can only achieve up to Level
                    Two, which can be enough for what you need, such as when breeding Pokemon during a picnic.</p>
                <h4>Union Circle</h4>
                <p>A fun yet flawed new feature, The Union Circle is a first for the Pokemon franchise and allows
                    you and up to three friends all to gather into the same game at the same time while online. Roam the
                    Paldea region together and if you are playing with a friend with the opposite version to yourself
                    take turns setting the pace and encounter the exclusive Pokemon to each game. Don't forget to bring
                    a Level 28 Palafin along and level up again for Palafin's Union Circle exclusive evolution.</p>
                <p>The flaws however in this unique feature do not take long to appear. With online co-op communication
                    between those involved is key. So first up being that if you want to explore Area Zero together.
                    For design reasons unknown once players desecend into Area Zero, those involved in the
                    Union Circle will no longer be visible to anyone in the party. So good luck trying to follow one
                    another without any open dialogue. Expanding on this point, if the party is not together then the
                    benefit of gaining access to version exclusive Poemon is lost until you find your invisible
                    partners.
                    Secondly and maybe most unfortunately. Playing the game while inside of The Union Circle, expect
                    your frame rate and game performance to drop through the floor escpecially when playing with 3-4
                    other trainers.</p>
