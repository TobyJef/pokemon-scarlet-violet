                <h2>Version differences and New Features</h2>
                <p>With a new generation of Pokemon comes new species of Pokemon, new regional forms, and new features.
                    There are some returning but altered features from previous main
                    series or spin off titles to fit the new design of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. The biggest of these
                    newest features come in the form on a fully open world map allowing full player freedom for
                    exploration.
                </p>
                <p>The introduction of The Union Circle allows for up to four players the chance join up and share their
                    Pokemon adventure together. Then there is the new Terra Raid dens, a built upon feature from the
                    raids of Pokemon Sword and Shield. Test your type match up knowledge by challenging Pokemon that
                    have a different base type to what you already know. Essentially creating the first tri
                    typed Pokemon.</p>
                <p>Smaller differences to mention depending on your version of the game. The name of the
                    Academy, the
                    colour and style of the school uniforms, red accented uniforms for Scarlet and blue for Violet. The
                    Your Pokemon Professors will be determined by what version you own which is a never before seen
                    addition.
                    Also the time period of the paradox Pokemon will vary. Will your preference for prehistoric or
                    futuristic sway your choice?
                    Unfortunately missing out for this generation is
                    having version exclusive Gym Leaders like in Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield which have not made a
                    return.

            <h3>The Open World</h3>
            <p>For our playthrough, the decision was made to explore the well sized open world around us, and get
                through
                the
                gyms and
                other over arching story lines in no particular order. With vast rolling fields, open seas, jungles,
                mountains and
                caves to
                explore, it is far too easy to spend your play session in getting lost and forgetting what you set out
                to do.
                Simply put the Paldea region is the largest map of any Pokemon game. We are still finding
                unchallenged
                static trainers to this day. The map although colourful, isn't the greatest however.
                Slightly
                sluggish to move through, no filter options and a limited zoom in and out it can make it difficult to
                quickly find what
                you are looking for. Even when zoomed out the map and it's icons can appear cluttered, showing
                everything all at once.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Gym Battles and Gym Challenges</h3>
            <p>So the basics of Gym Battles remain intact. Defeat the Gym Leader and their team of preffered type
                Pokemon
                and
                recieve a badge. That is where the familiarity ends. To now be able to earn the opportunity to battle a
                Gym Leader. Players now have to defeat the Gym Challenge first. To be honest, these challenges were a
                bit of
                a miss. At best they can be described as a mini game. Outside of that it feels more like added content
                to
                pad out the run time of the game. Our experience wanted to this be over with as soon as possible.
                Ever wanted to kick a giant inflatable olive around an obstacle course and then kick said inflatable
                olive
                into an open goal under a time limit? No? Well too bad because without it you can't take on the Gym
                Leader and progress your game otherwise.
                Sorry.
            </p>
            <p>Once you suffer through the Gym Challenges and take on the leader, we do get to experience the key battle
                gimmic that every new generation has. Once the Gym Leader is down to their signature Pokemon, except
                not a Pokemon any past generation gym leader would use. They will Terrastalise that Pokemon from it's
                base type to the Gym's preffered typing. However
                after
                the first few gyms however this new feature looses a some of it's interest. As you can continue the
                remainder of the battle as if you were against any of the other pokemon used within the Leaders party.
                By pressing the A button on your strongest Super Effective attack to win. An interesting concept for a
                feature, but one that could of been used more to add more of a challenge to the Gym Leader
                experience.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Terra Raids</h3>
            <p>One aspect where Terrastalised Pokemon does hit home is in the new Terra raid battles. One of the built
                upon
                features from Pokemon Sword and Shield. The Terra raids add the most to Scarlet and Violet's
                replayability for after the end credits have rolled. The raids range in difficulty from One to Six stars
                with time exclusive Seven star raids which gradually introduce returning Pokemon that were not included
                in the
                base
                game. One star raids are perfect for new players and the daily Six star raids are for those trainers
                looking
                for a challenge. Where these raids shine is the chance to take on Pokemon with typings that are not its
                own making you think more on not only your Pokemons strength and weaknesses but that of the Raid Pokemon
                also.</p>
            <p>
                These raids can be attempted by yourself or with a group of friends or randomly grouped strangers
                online. We
                do recommend to follow the general advice to give your team and yourself the best chance of
                success. Which is to raise your Pokemon to level 100, fully EV trained with items or the traditional way
                and that the Pokemon IV's are either Best or Hyper Trained. If you struggle with understanding the
                difference between your Pokemon IV's
                (Individual values) and EV's (Effort values) there are plenty of great resources online on
                this subject.
                However if you do find yourself struggling to come out on top remember to sign up to our newsletter as
                we
                cover the best strategies and Pokemon builds to bring along.</p>

            <h3>Picnics and Union Circle</h3>
            <h4>Sandwiches and more</h4>
            <p>Picnics are the Paldean variation to Sword and Shields camping and cooking mechanic. Picnics are
                primarily
                used for two things. First is breeding, gone are the days at dropping two Pokemon off at the Pokemon Day
                care for the purpose of breeding Pokemon eggs. Either to breed eggs of fully evolved Pokemon down to
                their
                stage
                one forms to fill gaps in the Pokedex or to breed your way to Pokemon genetic supremecy and the coverted
                Six
                Best IV's and preffered nature or the rare chance of hatching a shiny Pokemon. However with Hyper
                training
                and the use of mints to alter a Pokemons nature,
                breeding prefection for personal or competitive use is no longer the only way. Providing you in game
                wallet
                is deep enough.</p>
            <p>Purpose number two of the picnics is the new sandwich builder mechanic. Follow along your favourite in
                game
                recipe, place down the bread and layer on the toppings and finishing off the sandwich with a pick, to
                unlock
                a thirty minute game play boost. Want a better egg appearance and hatch rate? Make the Jam Sandwich.
                Want to
                encounter more Normal type Pokemon? Make the Fruit Sandwich. Each sandwich and it's fillings provided
                different boosts and at different levels, up to Level Three. With the more rare and expensive
                ingredients
                providing the better boosts. You can also purchase sandwiches and meals from different vendors around
                Paldea
                that can provide you with your desired boost. Although these boosts can only achieve up to Level Two,
                which
                can be enough for what you need, such as when breeding Pokemon during a picnic.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>Union Circle</h4>
            <p>A fun yet flawed new feature, The Union Circle is a first for the Pokemon franchise and allows
                you and up to three friends all to gather into the same game at the same time while online. Roam the
                Paldea
                region together and if you are playing with a friend with the opposite version to yourself take turns
                setting the pace and encounter the exclusive Pokemon to each game. Don't forget to bring a Level
                28 Palafin along and level up again for Palafin's Union Circle exclusive evolution.
            </p>
            <p>The flaws however in this unique feature do not take long to appear. With online co-op communication
                between those involved is key. So first up being that if you want to
                explore Area Zero
                together. For design reasons unknown once players desecend into Area Zero, those involved in the
                Union Circle will no longer
                be visible to anyone the party. So good luck trying to follow one another without any open
                dialogue.
                Continuing from this point, if the party is not together, then the benefit of gaining access to version
                exclusive Pokemon is lost until you find your invisible partners. Secondly and maybe most unfortunately.
                Playing the game while inside of The Union Circle, expect your frame rate and game performance to drop
                through the floor escpecially when playing with 3-4 other trainers.

            <div id="exclusive-text">
                <h3>Exclusive Pokemon</h3>
                <p>As always each game has it's version exclusive Pokemon. Each game has 24 version exclusive Pokemon,
                    that cannot be caught in the wild. These include the Legendary Pokemon that appear on
                    the front cover of each game. Koraidon will be found in Scarlet and Miraidon in Violet.
                </p>
                <p>In each version there are 14 exclusive wild Pokemon,
                    One
                    trade evolution and Seven Paradox Pokemon that can be found later in Area Zero near the end of
                    the
                    story.
                    There was an exclusive timed raid event Pokemon for each game, Scarlet recieving
                    Walking Wake and Violet recieving Iron Leaves. Both classed as Five Star Raids, these Terra
                    raids
                    were a signficant challenge, tougher than some Six Star Terra raids, both being accessible to
                    each game
                    through joining hosted online raids from the opposite version.</p>
                <p>To fully fill your Pokedex with the 400 Hundred Pokemon available within the game, as before you
                    will be
                    required
                    to trade for those Pokemon unobtainable to your version, try your luck with a mystery trade or
                    perhaps
                    join
                    an online terra raid party.</p>
