This website is a fan review of Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet. This page is for fans of the Pokemon franchise, and casual fans of the Pokemon video game, who may not have kept up to date with all the latest releases. This site aims to provide a space to read my honest review on the latest games release, also strategies on the limited time raid events for the Mightiest Mark Pokemon that are unable to obtain otherwise in the base game.

Underneath the site name, sits the navigation bar this directs users to the Home page, New Features page, Review page and Newsletter page.

Users can also click on the Pokeviews name within the site logo to re-direct them back to the Home page.

The navigation bar is styled in firebrick red. This colour was chosen to represent Pokemon Scarlet, the site links have been given white text and being set against the darker background helps give the navigation bar visual contrast and accessibility .

## New Features

This page is dedicated to explaining some of the new features added or improved upon from previous Pokemon Games and also the differences between the two versions of the game.

Due to the nature of the content, which may contain spoilers to those who have yet to play the game, specific details have been spared for the benefit of those readers.

What readers will expect to find is my thoughts on the games Open World, Gym Battles and the accompanying Gym Challenges. A list showing the exclusive Pokemon to each game, the new Tera Raids and Picnic game mechanics.

# Site Design

Altough the Pokeviews website was solely written by myself, the site was purposely written in a style to give the sense to the reader that there is a team of individuals that help contribute content to the website.

Styled blueviolet to match the Violet colour scheme, lighter shade of purple used for accessibility.

On larger screens the Exclusive Pokemon content text and image has been split to share the screen to accomodate the image height which shows the Pokemon that are exclusive to each game.
