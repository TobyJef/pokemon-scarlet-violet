## Opening Thoughts and Open World

The top of the New Features page contains three paragraphs explaining what new features has been added to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, what has been carried over and improved and what differences are to be found between each edition of the game.

Following on there is a short paragraph review the games open world mechanic, and an accompanying image of the full map of the Paldea region, taking in game from my own copy of the game.

A review of the gameplay about the Pokemon Gyms and the Gym challenges.

## Exclusive Pokemon

On larger screens the Exclusive Pokemon content text and image has been split to share the screen to accomodate the image height which shows the Pokemon that are exclusive to each game.

The text content covers how many exclusive Pokemon are within each game and details how they can be obtained.

The image styled to the right of the text content shows the list of what Pokemon are avaiable to which game and an image of the Pokemon or the Pokemons fully evolved form.

## Tera Raids

In this section placed underneath of the Exclusive Pokemon text and styled to the left of the Exclusive Pokemon image. I review Tera Raids one of the new statement features of the game. A new battle system that sets players against Pokemon of varying difficulty from One star to Six stars, with One star raids being the easiest in difficulty. There are also occassional limited time event Seven Star raids that feature a returning Pokemon from a previous title, but with a new elemental type. The raids of increased difficulty have been designed to encourage players to interact with the games online elements and take on the raids together.

## Picnics and Union Circle

### Sandwiches and more

A two paragraph review of the new picnic game mechanic that allows for players to create sandwiches that allow for different game enhancements such as increasing the chances of finding shiny Pokemon or increasing the rate at which Pokemon eggs hatch.
Regarding Pokemon eggs, picnics for this generation atleast replace the older game mechanic of the Pokemon Day Care. It allows for a more flexible way of breeding Pokemon and collecting the eggs.

### Union Circle

A brief explanation on a brand new multiplayer feature that allows for up to four players to simaltaniously connect to the game and explore the region together.

# Site Design

Altough the Pokeviews website was solely written by myself, the site was purposely written in a style to give the sense to the reader that there is a team of individuals that help contribute content to the website.
