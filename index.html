        <h2>Pokeviews on Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</h2>
        <p>Seven months have now passed since the release of Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet. The ninth entry into
            the Pokemon franchise and the second main series game to be released on the Nintendo Switch. Following
            mixed
            reviews from fans and critics alike of Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield and the mostly positive reception of
            Pokemon Legends Arceus. Have Nintendo and Gamefreak listened to the feedback? Produce what
            could be one of the best games in the franchise, or rush a game onto the ageing Switch
            hardware knowing that come release day, they can sit back and watch the revenue come streaming in
            as their legions of fans will empty the shelves of their local gaming stores or feverishly wait for the
            complete of the download from the Nintendo eShop.</p>
        <p>Well the team here at Pokeviews have you covered, we have extensively played through the main story and
            post game content,
            completed the Paldea Pokedex, tested our might against the Mightiest Mark Terra Raids and tried out all the
            new
            features the
            game has to offer. So join us over on the review page for our full honest take on Pokemon Scarlet and
            Violet,
