            <h2>Pokeviews on Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</h2>
            <p>Seven months have now passed since the release of Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet. The ninth entry
                into
                the Pokemon franchise and the second main series game to be released on the Nintendo Switch. After
                mixed reviews from fans and critics alike of Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield, followed by the mostly
                positive
                reception of Pokemon Legends Arceus. Have Nintendo and Gamefreak listened to the feedback? To produce
                what
                could be one of the best games in the Pokemon franchise, or deploy a game onto the ageing Switch
                hardware knowing that come release day, they can sit back and watch the revenue come streaming in
                as their legions of fans will empty the shelves of their local gaming stores or feverishly wait for the
                complete of the download from the Nintendo eShop.</p>

                tested
                the new features these
                games have to offer. </p>
