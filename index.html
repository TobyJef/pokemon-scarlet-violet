                <p class="text-spacing"></p>
                <p>Seven months have now passed since the release of Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet. The
                    ninth
                    entry
                    into
                    the Pokemon franchise and the second main series game to be released on the Nintendo Switch.
                    After
                    mixed reviews of Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield, and the
                    mostly
                    positive
                    reception of Pokemon Legends Arceus, have Nintendo and Gamefreak listened to the feedback?
                    To
                    produce
                    what
                    could be one of the best games in the Pokemon franchise, or deploy a game onto the ageing
                    Switch
                    hardware knowing that come release day, they can sit back and watch the revenue come
                    streaming
                    in
                    as their legions of fans will empty the shelves of their local gaming stores or feverishly
                    wait
                    for
                    the
                    complete of the download from the Nintendo eShop.</p>
